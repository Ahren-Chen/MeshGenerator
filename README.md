## How to run the product
### generate basic grid mesh
`just copy the command lines below and put them in any terminal`

mvn install

cd generator


java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh,gridMesh

ls -lh sample.mesh

cd ../

cd visualizer

java -jar visualizer.jar -input ../generator/sample.mesh -output sample.svg

ls -lh sample.svg

cd ../
### generate basic grid mesh with debug mood 
`just copy the command lines below and put them in any terminal`

mvn install

cd generator

java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh,gridMesh

ls -lh sample.mesh

cd ../

cd visualizer

java -jar visualizer.jar -input ../generator/sample.mesh -output sample.svg -X

cd ../
### generate basic random mesh
`just copy the command lines below and put them in any terminal`

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run: (Assuming you are already in the 'A2' directory)

```
mosser@azrael mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes one single argument (so far), the name of the file where the generated mesh will be stored as binary.

```
mosser@azrael cd generator 
mosser@azrael java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh
mosser@azrael ls -lh sample.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 sample.mesh
mosser@azrael cd ../
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments (so far): the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
mosser@azrael cd visualizer 
mosser@azrael java -jar visualizer.jar -input ../generator/sample.mesh -output sample.svg

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael cd ../
```

To visualize a mesh in debug mode, go to the `visualizer` directory, and use `java jar` to run the product. The product will take 3 arguments: the input file containing the mesh, the name of the output file, and the debug option -X

```
mosser@azrael cd visualizer 
mosser@azrael java -jar visualizer.jar -input ../generator/sample.mesh -output sample.svg -X

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael cd ../
```

To visualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first reinstall maven (as in `mvn install`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

## Possible Properties
Vertices: (Will assume default configurations if property is not given, or incorrect format)
- Color (Default: Black): 'rgba_color', 'R,G,B,A' (R, G, B, A are valid float numbers from 0-1. A is the alpha value (transparency), where 1 is visible and 0 is transparent)
- Centroid (Default: False): 'centroid', 'boolean' (Give True/False based on whether the vertex is a centroid)
- Thickness (Default: 3): 'thickness', 'int' (Give integer that is bigger than 0, describes the thickness of the vertex)

Segments: (Will assume default configurations if property is not given, or incorrect format)
- Color (Default: Black): 'rgba_color', 'R,G,B,A' (R, G, B, A are valid float numbers from 0-1. A is the alpha value (transparency), where 1 is visible and 0 is transparent)
- Thickness (Default: 3): 'thickness', 'int' (Give integer that is bigger than 0, describes the thickness of the segment)

Polygons: (Will assume default configurations if property is not given, or incorrect format)
- Color (Default: Black): 'rgba_color', 'R,G,B,A' (R, G, B, A are valid float numbers from 0-1. A is the alpha value (transparency), where 1 is visible and 0 is transparent)
