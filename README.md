### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run: (Assuming you are already in the 'A2' directory)

```
mosser@azrael mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes at least one argument, the name of the file where the generated mesh will be stored as binary.
## Mandatory arguments:
* output <insert a file name to output the mesh onto>

## Optional Arguments:
* Adding the "-h" or "-help" argument will display what options you can run the generator in
* [-gridMesh || -randomMesh || TetrakisSquare] Whichever of these options is given is the mesh the generator will generate. (Default is gridMesh)
* -polygonNum <insert number of polygons you want to generate (will be ignored if gridMesh type is chosen)
* -relaxationLevel <insert how smooth you want the irregular mesh is> (will be ignored if gridMesh type is chosen)
* -vThickness <insert how thick you want vertices to be generated as a double type> (will default to 3 is none is given)
* -segThickness <insert how thick you want segments to be generated as a double type> (will default to 3 is none is given)
* -width <insert integer of how big you want the mesh> (will default to 500)
* -height <insert integer of how big you want the mesh> (will default to 500)

## Example:

```
mosser@azrael cd generator 
mosser@azrael java -jar generator.jar -output sample.mesh -randomMesh -polygonNum 50 -relaxationLevel 5 -vThickness 2.7 -segThickness 10 -height 700 -width 700
mosser@azrael ls -lh sample.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 sample.mesh
mosser@azrael cd ../
```

### Island

To generate an island type from an existing mesh, go to `island` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product
takes an input mesh file and an output name for the resulting generated mesh. The product also takes in the `mode` of the island.

## Possible modes:
- lagoon, bridge, star (default: lagoon)

## Possible Soils:
- slow, medium, fast (default: slow)

## Possible elevation
- volcano, canyon, arctic, mountain (default: volcano)

## Possible biomes
- arctic, desert, grassland, rainforest (default: grassland)

## Possible heatMap
- none, elevation, precipitation, temperature (default: none)

## Example:

```
mosser@azrael cd island 
mosser@azrael java -jar island.jar -o island.mesh -i ../generator/sample.mesh -mode lagoon -lakes 5 -soil fast -seed 52 -aquifer 5 -elevation volcano -biomes desert -river 5 -heatMap none
mosser@azrael ls -lh island.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 island.mesh
mosser@azrael cd ../
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments (so far): the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
mosser@azrael cd visualizer 
mosser@azrael java -jar visualizer.jar -input ../generator/sample.mesh -output sample.svg

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael cd ../
```

To visualize a mesh in debug mode, go to the `visualizer` directory, and use `java jar` to run the product. The product will take 3 arguments: the input file containing the mesh, the name of the output file, and the debug option -X

```
mosser@azrael cd visualizer 
mosser@azrael java -jar visualizer.jar -input ../generator/sample.mesh -output sample.svg -X

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael cd ../
```

To visualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first reinstall maven (as in `mvn install`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

## Possible Properties
Vertices: (Will assume default configurations if property is not given, or incorrect format)
- Color (Default: Black): 'rgba_color', 'R,G,B,A' (R, G, B, A are valid float numbers from 0-1. A is the alpha value (transparency), where 1 is visible and 0 is transparent)
- Centroid (Default: False): 'centroid', 'boolean' (Give True/False based on whether the vertex is a centroid)
- Thickness (Default: 3): 'thickness', 'int' (Give integer that is bigger than 0, describes the thickness of the vertex)

Segments: (Will assume default configurations if property is not given, or incorrect format)
- Color (Default: Black): 'rgba_color', 'R,G,B,A' (R, G, B, A are valid float numbers from 0-1. A is the alpha value (transparency), where 1 is visible and 0 is transparent)
- Thickness (Default: 3): 'thickness', 'int' (Give integer that is bigger than 0, describes the thickness of the segment)

Polygons: (Will assume default configurations if property is not given, or incorrect format)
- Color (Default: Black): 'rgba_color', 'R,G,B,A' (R, G, B, A are valid float numbers from 0-1. A is the alpha value (transparency), where 1 is visible and 0 is transparent)

## Centroid Resources:
-Color (different color will represent different resources)
1.seafoodResources = Color.CYAN;

2.freshwaterFish = Color.BLUE;

3.cropResources = Color.ORANGE;

4.mineralsResource = Color.PINK;

5.fruitResource = Color.RED;

6.oil_gasResource = Color.BLACK;

and the thickness of each centroid will determine the output of resource production (thicker = more resources)
